# Gatsby Book Review Site

A port of my [old CRA + Express + MongoDB project](https://react-book-reviews.herokuapp.com/) to Gatsby.

This version does away with the Express and MongoDB backend and replaces it with the Contentful headless CMS. Now one can easily log in to Contentful and write reviews. We can also now take advantage of the amazing image optimization we get for free with Gatsby.
