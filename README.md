# Gatsby Book Review Site

A port of my [old CRA + Express + MongoDB project](https://react-book-reviews.herokuapp.com/) to Gatsby.

This version does away with the Express and MongoDB backend and replaces it with the Contentful headless CMS. Now one can easily log in to Contentful and write reviews. We can also now take advantage of the amazing image optimization we get for free with Gatsby.

TODO: Populate single review pages with all data.
TODO: Finish porting over styling.

Eventually would like to port the styling over to a more modern solution like Emotion / Styled Components.
